# Game Station - A Gaming community platform where Gamers Hangouts, Trade Gaming Assets and Tokenize their game play moments. 

### At Game Station, our aim is to build a community platform where Gamers can connect with each other, trade their gaming assets as well as create value by minting their Game play moments.

### So here I will walk you through the platform we have built:
1) First users needs to connect with metamask to interact with the platform



2) Create Post: Gamers can create a post with their Game updates/achievements etc and mint it as an NFT.  Minting NFT and tokenizing posts ensures that the user owns it.




3) Trade Gaming Assets: In Web3 we all own our assets in the form of NFT which can help user sell their game assets rather than letting it sit in our Wallet.

4) Game Play NFTs: As we see Gaming, Esport,  etc are growing which means userâ€™s can now even create value from his/her talent of playing and can mint and TraderNFTs accordingly.

5) Reward System: Still there are Web2 users who have not started using Web3 apps so to help them learn, we are going to incentivize users for different actions such as connect wallet, mint NFT etc. 


#### So far we have built this much by using : 1) Polygon L2 2) IPFS/File coin to store NFT meta data 3) Moralis Cloud functions and 4) Covalent to fetch NFT transactions.

 ## Our Future plans:


Web3 is like more we build, more we learn and our next plan is to learn more about Blockchain Gaming, take reviews of current work we have done and then launch it on the main net with required changes.
